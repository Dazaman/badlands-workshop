    "In this example, we investigate the formation of river-dominated deltas under _steady climatic conditions_ (uniform precipitation) and _sea-level fluctuations_. Our goal is to reproduced **first-order sea-level control on river deltas formation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial surface defines a mount which is a half ellipsoid of 2 km height and a circular diameter of 8 km. The sea-level is initially set at the base of this mount at an elevation of 0 m. A uniform precipitation rate of 1 m/a is applied on the entire area and we test the evolution of the surface and associated deposits due to both hillslope and channel flow. Two diffusion coefficients are defined for the aerial (0.3 m2/a) and marine (0.5 m2/a) environments. The higher value for the marine environment is used to account for sediments reworking by waves and/or currents. The simulation runs for 0.5 Ma and we vary the sea-level through time.\n",
